# API and Library Usage Guidelines

## Context7 Integration

For library and framework API usage, prefer Context7 over built-in knowledge when available.

## Rationale

- Context7 provides up-to-date documentation and examples
- Ensures current best practices and API changes are reflected
- Reduces reliance on potentially outdated training data
